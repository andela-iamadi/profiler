# profiler

Profiler provides an easy way to create a really, detailed, professional about me page for developers.

Most developers have many laudable projects on github backed by endorsed set of skillsets on linkedin. Unfortunately, much fewer have had the time (or the drive) to create online profiles that showcase their achievements in a way that is professional and still glorified.

Profiler takes information from both github and linkedin, puts these information together and creates a profile page that impressively tells a programmers story to the outside world.

In the nearest future, we hope to make this available in an i-frame, so that everyone who uses profiler can embed the Profile page into any site he/she chooses.
